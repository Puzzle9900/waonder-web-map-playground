Using as a template Specs generator .claude/loops/writeSpecLoop.md

1 - Create the specs of this project into ./specs
2 - Read existing ./specs
3 - We want to build web application using NextJS that is able to display a map of earth. The map will be able to render h3 geographical cell any place the cursor is places. The map will display on the top left the zoom level of the map and when touching a H3 cell it will display the cell and the resolution and hash identifier of the cell.
4 - If the work is too complex to be addressed in a single Spec create a master Spec and divide the work in smaller milestones specs.
5 - This is a client only application it does not require to connect to any external api.
6 - Web can be used to find out documentation.
7 - Improve spec to make the work the most deterministic as possible.

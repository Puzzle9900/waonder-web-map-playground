All document in ./tech-specs are your source of truth

1 - Read tech spec
2 - Create/update a implementation plan in the folder ./impl-plan that will consist of a single file with a todo list of everything we need to complete in order to meet everything mentioned in the tech spec.
3 - None of the files inside ./tech-specs will be changed since that is the source of truth
4 - This plan will have a clean format since later will be used to complete one by one each one of the requirements.

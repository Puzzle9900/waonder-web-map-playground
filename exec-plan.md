Read the implementation plan in ./impl-plan and ./tech-specs

- Pick only one of the tasks not completed in the correct order to generate progress.
- Solve the task.
- Verify the project is working/building at this stage.
- Mark the task as completed in the plan. Only if the app is working at the stage
- Mark the task as completed in the ./tech-specs if needed.
- Add new tasks to impl-plan if needed always as it meets with the tech-specs requirmements.
- Never change tech-specs since it is the source of truth.
- Ensure do not break any of the completed tasks.
- Ensure project is working fine after complete the tasks.
